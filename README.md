# NeuralNet
 Repository for development of a trainable vanilla neural network, inspired by Michael Nielsen's book on neural networks (available online at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), **extended with additional functionalities and vectorized for improved efficiency**.

 This repository also includes an optimizaton study of this basic neural network on the **MNIST dataset**.
